notes
------

to do
 - clean up code
 - clean up CDL format specs
 - move prototype to production loop
 - CrIS to CHIRP

Starting from an existing netCDF file (a UW CrIS granule) I've been
able to dump the CDL format spec, edit it extensively, removing some
variables and add new ones, write an empty netCDF file from the CDL
spec, and write data to the netCDF file.  The UW file (and I think
all the new NASA netCDF products) are bloated and groaning with
attributes, and my new netCDF file is, too.  Creating something like
that from scratch would be a major hassle, but copying and modifying
it is not as bad.

../chirp_test > ncdump -h uw_sdr_test.nc > uw_sdr_test.cdl
../chirp_test > ncgen -o ncgen_test.nc uw_sdr_test.cdl
