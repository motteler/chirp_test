  a2cris_lin      - airs2cris linearization test
  a2cris_srfs     - airs2cris linearization with SRF plots
  airs_num_synth  - multi-granule count of L1cNumSynth values
  check_synth     - counts for synthetic and fixed channels

relevant functions from other repos
------------------------------------
  L1c_fields
  airs_obs_list
  airs_obs_batch

netCDF format
--------------
  chirp_init.cdl  - CHIRP SDR netCDF CDL template
  chirp_init.nc   - CHIRP SDR netCDF initial file

notes
------

to do
 - CrIS to CHIRP prototype (should be relatively simple)
 - derived numsynth, basic QC, Larrabee's QC stats
 - NEdN (from paper)

Starting from an existing netCDF file (a UW CrIS granule) I've been
able to dump the CDL format spec, edit it extensively, removing some
variables and add new ones, write an empty netCDF file from the CDL
spec, and write data to the netCDF file.  The UW file (and I think
all the new NASA netCDF products) are bloated and groaning with
attributes, and my new netCDF file is, too.  Creating something like
that from scratch would be a major hassle, but copying and modifying
it is not as bad.

../chirp_test > ncdump -h uw_sdr_test.nc > uw_sdr_test.cdl
../chirp_test > ncgen -o ncgen_test.nc uw_sdr_test.cdl
