netCDF notes
-------------
chirp initial netcdf file from CDL spec

  ncgen -o chirp_master.nc chirp_master.cdl

Starting from an existing netCDF file (a UW CrIS granule) I've been
able to dump the CDL format spec, edit it extensively, removing some
variables and add new ones, write an empty netCDF file from the CDL
spec, and write data to the netCDF file.  The UW file (and I think
all the new NASA netCDF products) include a lot of global attributes,
and my new netCDF file is, too.  Creating something like that from
scratch would be a major hassle, but copying and modifying it is not
as bad.

CDL spec extrated from a netCDF file

  ncdump -h uw_sdr_test.nc > uw_sdr_test.cdl

Initial netcdf file from a CDL spec

  ncgen -o ncgen_test.nc uw_sdr_test.cdl

Compilation notes
------------------
The environment variable MCR_CACHE_ROOT will set an alternate path
to the .mcrCache9.8 (or whatever) directory.  The directory is set
at runtime, not at compile time, and you can move it around by
changing MCR_CACHE_ROOT without recompiling.  ctfroot called at
runtime returns this path.

Beware "ls" may miss .mcrCache9.8 since it's a "dotfile".  

We don't want the "-C" option, that seems to always create the cache
directory in the run directory.
