HISTORY

  CHIRP evolved from work on an AIRS-to-CrIS translation, which
  in turn was based on our AIRS deconvolution.  This is described
  in [1] and is available as a git repo [2].

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

  Thanks to Scott Hannon for the AIRS SRF tabulations and for early
  encouragement on fundamentals of the AIRS deconvolution.
