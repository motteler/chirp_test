Here's what I proposed for a chirp SDR format back on 27 Nov 2018
over in slack/data-formats:

CrIS native format, in column order
  nchan x 9 x 30 x 45  = nchan x 12150 obs, flattened for CHIRP

AIRS native format, in column order
  nchan x 90 x 135 = nchan x 12150 obs, flattened for CHIRP

The native formats are in time order for AIRS, and time and FOV
order for CrIS.  Note that netCDF and many languages will represent
this data in row order, for example 135 x 90 x nchan for AIRS.  Row
vs column order doesn't matter if you flatten the arrays to vectors
and keep them in time order.

We also need flattened FOV and FOR indices for CrIS CHIRP:
   9 x 30 x 45 = 12150 FOV values
   9 x 30 x 45 = 12150 FOR values

That's the main story.  Of course you have to similarly flatten all
the supporting data--time, lat, lon, sol zen, sat zen, etc.
