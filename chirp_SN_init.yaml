# Evan's sample runtime config split into processing options
# (proc_opts) and product attributes (prod_attr).  This version
# (chirp_cris_init.yaml) is a template for processing a set of
# granules, so some values, like cris filename, granule number,
# and processing time are just filler to be set properly as the
# individual granules are processed.
#
# I've left the prod_attr fields Evan set alone, and added some
# proc_opts fields.  These all have the names I was already using,
# but that would not be hard to change.
#
# CHIRP sample runtime configuration file for CrIS-source data
# Format:
#   line order doesn't matter
#   blank lines don't matter
#   '#' is comment-to-end-of-line
#   all other lines are of the form:
#      [ows]TAG[ows]:[ows]VALUE[ows]
#     where:
#        [ows] is optional whitespace, and commbination of tabs and space characters
#        TAG is a literal tag from a set of tags agreed between JPL Sounder SIPS and UMBC ASL
#        VALUE is the desired value
#
# If duplicate lines are present with the same tag then the last one is the one that is used

  # The netCDF template file to use
